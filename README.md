## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

I have selected two artworks: A poster named *Space* from Magdiel Lopez and a digital artwork named *Blue Light District* by Andrea koroveshi. These images evoke a sense of uncontrolled gravity, creating a feeling of floating and falling for the viewers. This sensation sparks a fantastical experience of gravity, exploring the unknown phenomena one might encounter in space or underwater. It provides a unique visual effect that can captivate the audience's interest and imagination. By implementing the gravity effect, I can better express the themes or concepts of the project, offering viewers a distinct visual experience. Additionally, this technique can enhance the project's creativity and appeal.
